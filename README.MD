## Installation:

Requires Python 2.7

```bash
pip install usabilla-api
```

## Examples:
The example folder contains an  example of the client, which gives an idea how the client can be used and what is possible.


## Iterators

When working with the <code>limit</code> parameters (default value is **100**) you can request resources using the <code>item_iterator()</code> function.
The API returns data in pages. This function returns a [Generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) which
traverses these pages for you and yields each result in the current page before retrieving the next page.
