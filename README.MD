## Installation:

Requires Python 3. 
Support for Python 2.7 is expected but not tested or validated.

```bash
pip install usabilla-api
```

## Examples

The example folder contains an  example of the client, which gives an idea how the client can be used and what is possible.

### Iterators

When working with the <code>limit</code> parameters (default value is **100**) you can request resources using the <code>item_iterator()</code> function.
The API returns data in pages. This function returns a [Generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) which
traverses these pages for you and yields each result in the current page before retrieving the next page.

## Support

The Usabilla Python Client API is maintained by Usabilla Development Team. Everyone is encouraged to file bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests through GitHub. This input is critical and will be carefully considered, but we canâ€™t promise a specific resolution or time frame for any request.
